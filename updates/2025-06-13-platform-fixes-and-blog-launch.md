We've just pushed a chunky round of frontend improvements:

- ✅ **Featured Cards block** now displays correctly across all screen sizes.  
- ✅ **Set pages** (like `/set/sv2`) are now fully live and styled — they look and behave just like search results, but scoped to a specific set.  
- ✅ **Blog** is officially launched at `/blog` — we’ll be publishing behind-the-scenes insights, market trends, and collector tips here moving forward.

🧹 **Coming next**: We’re kicking off a **platform-wide pricing audit** to fix any null or clearly incorrect values across the full card database. This includes checking historical scrape issues and rerunning filters for accuracy.

🛎 **New**: A “Report an Issue” button will be going live shortly to let you flag specific card pages if something looks off.

Thanks for sticking with us — the binder’s getting smarter every day.
