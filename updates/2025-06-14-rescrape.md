title: "🛠️ Full Database Rescrape Underway (All 18,000+ Cards)"
date: "2025-06-14"
excerpt: "We're running a complete rescrape of every card to clean up old data and fully switch to the new price logic. Expect improved accuracy and a short transition period."

We're currently running a **full re-scrape of every single card in the PokéBinder database — over 18,000 unique entries.**

This is part of a major system cleanup to ensure **every price you see is based on the latest, cleanest logic**. In recent weeks, we discovered that **older scraper runs were including flawed or incomplete data** due to outdated filtering rules. That affected accuracy — and we take that seriously.

## 🔄 What's Happening

- ✅ The new scraper logic is now live.
- 🔁 All 18,000 cards are being re-processed from scratch using it.
- 🧠 Each card is being checked for real UK eBay sales, active listings, and TCGPlayer fallback data.
- 🏷️ Once updated, each card gets reassigned to the right tier based on live market value.

## 🧘 What This Means For You

- Some cards may still show odd or outdated prices for the next **24–72 hours**.
- You might notice delays in clean values appearing for less common cards — this is expected during the refresh.
- Once the run is complete, accuracy will be dramatically improved site-wide.

This is a **one-time deep clean**, and once done, the system will automatically stay fresh with daily smart scrapes based on tier priority.

Thanks for your patience while we finish tightening the bolts. We’re building this for real collectors — and that means being honest when something’s off, and transparent about how we fix it.

Stay tuned. It’s going to be worth it.
