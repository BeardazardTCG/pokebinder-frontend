PokéBinder started as a spreadsheet.

Just a rough little tool to help track what my cards were actually worth — not inflated TCGPlayer guesses or comic shop markups. I was buying, selling, trading, and realised quickly: **there was no accurate, live UK price source for Pokémon cards.**

So I built one.

What you're seeing now is just the beginning:
- ✅ Live eBay sold listings, cleaned daily
- ✅ Active listings and TCGPlayer prices
- ✅ Accurate UK market values
- ✅ Real tools made by real collectors

We’re here to fix what’s been missing — not just for sellers and flippers, but for genuine collectors who want clarity, value, and a bit of magic in their binder again.

This is built by hand. No corporate team. No suits. Just obsession, caffeine, and a bit of AI to help.

Let’s make PokéBinder the most useful, honest, collector-first Pokémon site on the web.

More updates coming soon.
