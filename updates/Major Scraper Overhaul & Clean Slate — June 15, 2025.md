### ✅ Major Scraper Overhaul & Clean Slate — June 15, 2025

We've just completed a **critical overhaul** of our entire eBay sold scraper system.

After identifying multiple silent failures in filtering logic, missing logs, and outdated search queries — we took it back to zero.

---

### 🧼 What we’ve done:

* Rebuilt the **eBay sold scraper** with full logging, debug tracking, and clear rejection reasons
* Patched **query logic** across 17,000+ cards (no more broken `/` card numbers or bloated search terms)
* Flushed all old or corrupted price logs — **everything pre-filter-fix is gone**
* Launched a fresh live scrape of the full database using the **final, verified logic**
* Cleaned and stabilized the database — no bloat, no junk, no noise

---

### 📊 As of now, PokéBinder is:

* Running fully live with real UK market data
* Using clean filters, strict logic, and full URL traceability
* Logging every scrape, every rejection, and every trusted median
* Currently mid-scrape — **some prices may appear missing or unreliable** during the next 15 hours

---

### ⏳ When will pricing be accurate again?

We're actively scraping all 17,000+ cards with final logic.
This process will take around **15 hours to complete** — once done, prices will auto-update sitewide with verified data.

Until then, please treat any prices shown as **incomplete**.

---

### ✨ What’s next?

Once this scrape completes, we’ll light up:

* Smart Suggestions
* Trend Tracker
* Wishlist & inventory syncing
* Live price graphs across all cards

Thanks for your patience — this wasn’t just a patch.
This was the reset we needed to do things properly.

**We’re live. We’re clean. We’re ready.**
