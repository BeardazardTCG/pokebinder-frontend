# 📢 PokéBinder Update: Free Code Giveaway + Card Bundle Draws!

We’re kicking off our beta launch with a simple (and real) thank you to every collector helping us grow.

### 🎁 What’s Included:

* **Instant Reward:** When you sign up with your email, you’ll immediately receive a real, unused Pokémon TCG Online code card — yours to keep.
* **Big Prize Draw:** For every 50 people who sign up, we randomly pick one to win a **50-card bundle**, sent directly to you in the UK. These are genuine playable cards from our own stock (not junk energy lots).

### 🔒 No Spam. No Strings.

We only email you for major feature drops, collector tools, and big price shifts. That’s it. We don’t sell data, and we don’t flood inboxes.

### 📦 Why This Matters

PokéBinder is built for UK collectors — by real collectors. This isn’t a corporation trying to fleece you with “average prices.” It’s a clean, honest, automated price tracker powered by live eBay and TCG listings.

Your signup does three things:

1. Unlocks your free code card
2. Enters you into the 50-card bundle draw
3. Helps us grow the platform for everyone

Thanks for being part of the launch. More tools. More insight. More power to the player.

— PokéBinder Team
