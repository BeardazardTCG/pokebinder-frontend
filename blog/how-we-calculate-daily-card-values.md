If you’ve ever looked at 10 listings for the same card and seen **10 different prices**, you’re not alone.

We built PokéBinder to cut through that chaos — and deliver a fair, clean value that UK collectors can trust.

## Here’s What We Do (Every Day)

For each card, we:

1. **Scrape recent eBay UK sold listings**  
   (up to 240 per card, refreshed on a tiered schedule)

2. **Filter**: 
   - Bundles
   - Slabs
   - Damaged cards
   - Foreign languages
   - Obvious scams or fakes

3. **Remove Outliers**  
   Extreme highs and lows are flagged and excluded using two-pass statistical filtering.

4. **Calculate Medians and Ranges**  
   We log the price range seen and assign a **clean average** you can trust.

5. **Update Every Day**  
   Cards update based on value + priority (Charizard daily, bulk commons less often).

## Why It Works

- **UK buyers only**
- **No guesswork**
- **Transparent, visible listings**
- **Works for vintage and modern cards**
