### “TCGPlayer says my card is worth $40... so why can’t I sell it for £32?”

Welcome to one of the biggest problems UK collectors face.

Pokémon pricing tools — even the biggest ones — are built for the **US market**.

---

## 🇺🇸 US Tools = US Data

Sites like TCGPlayer, PriceCharting, and even some apps pull prices from:

- US eBay listings (not sold)
- TCGPlayer sales (US-only)
- Graded marketplaces (PSA/BGS slabs)

These prices often look **higher** — but they don’t reflect what UK buyers are actually paying.

---

## 🇬🇧 UK Reality = eBay.co.uk

Here’s what affects UK prices:

- Currency conversion + VAT
- International shipping costs
- Smaller buyer pool
- Lower demand for English cards in Europe

Result?  
**A card that sells for $40 in the US might go for £24–29 in the UK.**
