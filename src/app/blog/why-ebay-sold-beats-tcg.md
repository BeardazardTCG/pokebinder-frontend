title: "Why eBay Sold Listings Beat TCG Prices — Every Time"

When it comes to Pokémon card pricing, most collectors still default to TCGPlayer — but if you're in the UK or buying internationally, you're getting a skewed view.

Here’s why eBay sold listings are the gold standard:

---

### 1. TCGPlayer ≠ Real Market  
TCGPlayer reflects the *listing floor* — not what cards actually **sell** for. Sellers often race to the bottom to appear first, even if their card sits unsold for weeks.

---

### 2. eBay Shows Verified Demand  
With sold listings, you’re seeing the **actual sale price**, **date**, and even **condition**. That gives you market-accurate values, not wishful thinking.

---

### 3. International Reality Check  
For UK collectors, TCGPlayer prices are in USD, shipping is often unrealistic, and customs fees aren’t factored in. eBay gives you GBP-based, locally relevant, real-world pricing.

---

### 4. Flippers and Investors Use eBay  
Every serious reseller, flipper, or investor looks at eBay sold history — not TCGPlayer. Why? Because it’s how they price their own sales.

---

### Final Word  
TCGPlayer is useful — especially for sealed product or ballpark rarity tiers. But if you want **real market intelligence**, eBay sold data is how the smart collectors value cards.

That’s exactly what PokéBinder tracks.
