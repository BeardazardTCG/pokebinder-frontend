When it comes to Pokémon card pricing, most collectors still default to TCGPlayer.

But if you're in the UK — or buying internationally — you're getting a **skewed view**.

Here’s why **eBay sold listings are the gold standard** for real-time Pokémon TCG value tracking:

---

### 🧮 1. TCGPlayer ≠ Real Market

TCGPlayer shows the **listing floor**, not the sale price.  
Most sellers race to the bottom to show up first — even if their cards sit unsold for weeks.

The result?  
A price that **looks low**, but doesn't reflect real demand or sale velocity.

---

### ✅ 2. eBay Shows Verified Demand

Sold listings on eBay tell you:
- What someone **actually paid**  
- When they bought it  
- The **card condition**, often with photos  
- Whether it was a UK buyer or not

It’s the **closest thing to verified market truth**.

---

### 🌍 3. International Reality Check

For UK collectors, TCGPlayer is in:
- 💵 USD  
- 📦 High shipping  
- 🧾 Customs blind spots

eBay sold data is:
- 💷 GBP-based  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 From UK sellers  
- 🚚 Real-world pricing that reflects what *you’d* pay

---

### 📊 4. Flippers and Investors Use eBay — Not TCG

Every serious card flipper checks eBay sold history.  
Why? Because it shows:
- Sell-through rates  
- Demand cycles  
- And what actually converts to cash

No investor builds a buylist off TCGPlayer floor listings — and neither should you.

---

### 💡 Final Word

TCGPlayer is useful — especially for sealed product trends and US rarity tiers.

But if you want **real market intelligence**, especially in the UK...  
eBay sold listings are the only way to go.
