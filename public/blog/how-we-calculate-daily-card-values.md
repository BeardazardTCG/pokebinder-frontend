If you’ve ever looked at 10 listings for the same card and seen **10 different prices**, you’re not alone.

We built PokéBinder to cut through that chaos — and deliver a fair, clean value that UK collectors can trust.

## Here’s What We Do (Every Day)

For each card, we:

1. **Monitor real UK sales from eBay**  
   We check recent sold listings — up to 240 per card — using structured search methods.

2. **Apply Smart Filters**  
   We automatically exclude:
   - Multi-card bundles
   - Graded/slabbed items
   - Damaged or written-on cards
   - Foreign language versions
   - Obvious fakes or misleading listings

3. **Remove Outliers**  
   Unrealistically high or low sales are flagged and filtered out using our own 2-layer detection process.

4. **Log Price Ranges and Medians**  
   We record the price spread and calculate a **clean average** that reflects the true UK market.

5. **Update Daily**  
   Cards update at different speeds depending on relevance and volume.  
   - 🔥 Hot cards (e.g. Charizard) update daily  
   - 💤 Bulk commons update less often
