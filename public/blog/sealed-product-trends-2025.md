Looking to park your cash in sealed Pokémon product?

Here are the top 3 sets **actually holding their value** in 2025 — based on verified UK market data and real eBay sales logged by PokéBinder.

---

### 🔥 1. **Hidden Fates** (2019)

- 📈 Still trending upward year over year  
- 🎯 High demand for full-art shiny vault cards  
- 📦 ETBs consistently clearing **£110–£130**

**Why it holds:**  
Perceived long-term scarcity + timeless appeal from the Shiny Vault chase cards.

---

### 🔥 2. **Crown Zenith** (2023)

- 🆕 Technically modern, but with long-term chase value  
- 🎨 Galarian Gallery demand drives sealed interest  
- 📦 ETBs + mini tins performing **above RRP**, especially sealed bundles

**Why it holds:**  
Low restock frequency + art-first collector obsession.

---

### 🔥 3. **XY Evolutions** (2016)

- 💬 Love it or hate it — it won’t go away  
- 🕹️ Base Set reprint appeal is unmatched for new wave collectors  
- 📦 Booster boxes still selling for **£450–£500 sealed**

**Why it holds:**  
Pure nostalgia. Combine that with shrinking supply and Evolutions remains a sealed powerhouse.

---

### ⚠️ Quick Tip:

Avoid:
- Job lots  
- “Mystery bundles”  
- Anything not factory-sealed and traceable  

If it’s not shrink-wrapped and searchable on eBay, it’s likely priced to confuse — not to grow.
