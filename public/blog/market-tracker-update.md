Ever wondered how PokéBinder gets its card values?  

It’s not just an API feed — it’s a layered system designed for **accuracy**, **UK relevance**, and **collector trust**.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Monitoring Real UK Listings

Every day, we gather updated data from eBay UK for both **sold** and **currently active** listings.  
We use filters like:
- UK sellers only  
- Gallery mode enabled  
- No bundles, slabs, or misleading entries

This ensures the pricing is **realistic**, not bloated by edge cases or reseller noise.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Filtering Out the Junk

Before anything is logged, we remove:
- Damaged or clearly mislabeled cards  
- Listings with fake sold quantities (e.g. 10 sold at £0.01)  
- PSA, CGC, and bundle deals that distort the individual price

We also **flag sharp spikes** to prevent a single odd sale from skewing the value.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Clean Price Calculation

PokéBinder uses a smart fallback system based on **data confidence**:

1. **eBay UK sold median** (up to 90 days)  
2. **eBay UK active listings** (for demand range)  
3. **TCGPlayer** (only as a fallback for missing cards)

The **“Live Market Estimate”** you see on each card is based on whichever source offers the clearest picture.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Tier-Based Update Logic

Not every card updates at the same speed — and that’s intentional.

- 🔥 **High-value or popular cards** are updated daily  
- 💤 **Bulk or ultra-low demand cards** update less frequently

This keeps the system fast, efficient, and laser-focused on what matters.

---

### 🧠 Why This Works

- Everything is tied to **real UK activity**
- Every price is linked to a real transaction  
- You can see **what sold, when, and how much** — directly on each card page  
- There’s **no guesswork** — only real data, filtered cleanly

---

PokéBinder isn’t just a card database.  
It’s a living, evolving market tracker for UK collectors who care about **truthful prices** — not inflated hype.
