### “TCGPlayer says my card is worth $40... so why can’t I sell it for £32?”

Welcome to one of the biggest problems UK collectors face.

Pokémon pricing tools — even the biggest ones — are built for the **US market**, not ours.

---

## 🇺🇸 US Tools = US Data

Sites like TCGPlayer, PriceCharting, and various price apps rely on:

- US eBay listings (often not sold)  
- TCGPlayer sales (US-only)  
- Graded market listings (PSA/BGS slabs)

These prices tend to **look higher** — but they don’t reflect what UK buyers are actually paying in the real world.

---

## 🇬🇧 UK Reality = eBay.co.uk

Here’s what actually affects UK market prices:

- 💱 Currency conversion + VAT  
- 🚚 International shipping costs  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Smaller buyer pool  
- 🌍 Lower demand for English cards across Europe

**Result?**  
A card that sells for $40 in the US might only go for **£24–£29 in the UK** — and that’s the real number that matters if you're buying or selling locally.
