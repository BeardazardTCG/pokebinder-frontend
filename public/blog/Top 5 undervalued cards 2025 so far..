🔥 Top 5 Most Undervalued Pokémon Cards in the UK Right Now (2025)

Pokémon card prices shift fast — and most sites track only US trends or inflated BIN listings. At PokéBinder, we scan real eBay UK sold prices daily, and some cards are slipping through the cracks...

Here are 5 cards seriously underpriced in the UK market right now 👇

🧊 1. Mewtwo (Base Set, #10/102)

Recent UK solds: £8.50–£13.00 (Near Mint)

TCGPlayer average: £20+ (converted)

Why it’s undervalued: Constant listings mean collectors overlook it — but clean Mewtwos are drying up, and PSA submissions are rising. Solid mid-tier hold.

🌿 2. Branblin (SV02 #22)

Recent UK sales: £7.00–£9.00

Reason: New gen sleeper. Huge competitive play spike in Japan — hasn’t caught on in UK yet.

Watch for: Price bumps post meta rotation.

💦 3. Swanna (SV02 #27)

Sold as low as: £1.75 (!)

Why it’s a sleeper: Part of a niche collection trend (regional bird lines). Underrated art, low pop in good condition.

Affiliate deals available in active listings now.

⚙️ 4. Porygon2 (SV02 #49)

Recent spread: £1.32–£17.84 (!)

Why it’s volatile: Condition-sensitive, overlooked, but getting picked up by TCG AI sellers. Watch this range tighten.

🔥 5. Bramblin (SV02 #22)

Dual role card: Both competitive and collector interest.

Fair market: Around £7.03 at time of writing.

Why it matters: It’s cards like these that big platforms miss — PokéBinder doesn’t.
