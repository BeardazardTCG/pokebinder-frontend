Pokémon card prices shift fast — and most sites track only US trends or inflated Buy It Now listings.  

At PokéBinder, we track **real eBay UK sold prices daily**, and some cards are slipping under the radar...

Here are **5 cards seriously underpriced in the UK market right now** 👇

---

### 🧊 1. [**Mewtwo** (Base Set #10/102)](/card/base1-10)

- **Recent UK Sales:** £8.50–£13.00 (Near Mint)  
- **TCGPlayer Average (converted):** £20+  

**Why it’s undervalued:**  
Constant listings mean collectors overlook it — but clean Base Mewtwos are drying up. PSA submissions are on the rise. Solid mid-tier hold if NM or better.

---

### 🌿 2. [**Bramblin** (SV02 #22)](/card/sv2-22)

- **Recent UK Sales:** £7.00–£9.00  

**Reason:**  
Sleeper from the Scarlet & Violet era.  
Huge spike in competitive play in Japan — hasn’t caught on in the UK yet.

🔍 **Watch for:** Meta changes and rotation impact in upcoming tourneys.

---

### 💦 3. [**Swanna** (SV02 #27)](/card/sv2-27)

- **Sold as low as:** £1.75 (!)

**Why it’s a sleeper:**  
Part of a niche regional bird collection trend.  
Underrated art, undergraded copies, and low pop in strong condition.

⚡ Affiliate Buy-It-Now deals available via PokéBinder card page.

---

### ⚙️ 4. [**Porygon2** (SV02 #49)](/card/sv2-49)

- **Recent Spread:** £1.32–£17.84 (!)

**Why it’s volatile:**  
Condition-sensitive. Often overlooked, but TCG AI sellers are starting to scoop listings and auto-relist.  

⏳ Expect the range to tighten as copies sell out.

---

### 🔥 5. [**Bramblin** (SV02 #22)](/card/sv2-22)

Yes — again. This one deserves a second mention.

**Dual role card:**  
- Competitively viable  
- Strong art + collector cross-interest  

**Clean average market:** ~£7.03  
Don’t be surprised if it jumps post-rotation.

---

No slabs.
